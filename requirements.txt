Stripe integration
*Users should have a stripe customer token in the users table.
*javascript should prevent pro form from submitting once the user has filled it out
and send card information to stripe servers. Stripe will return with a card token
*Javascript should then return user field and card token to rails app. Rails app
will note wheather plan_id = 1/2
Once validated rails should return user information and card token back to stripe,
so stripe can create a subscribtion and return a customer token. Rails should
then save customer token and information to our database.
